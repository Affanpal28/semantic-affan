    <p>Today is not a beautiful day because my internet sucks.I'm putting together a random paragraph generator and have written 50 random paragraphs, but I need a lot more to populate it to make it more useful...and I find that my paragraphs seem to stay around the same themes. If you're looking for a bit of writing motivation and would like to contribute a paragraph or two to my project, it would be greatly appreciated. You can either leave it in the comments or send it to me in a PM. Thank you in advance!
